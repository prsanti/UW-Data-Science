    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed.  Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e., an average gain on 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%.  A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money. Determine the following:\n",

Given the current sampling parameters (sample size of 20 and std. dev. of population. 6), what is the probability that the new rewards system reduced absenteeism to 16 hours and you miss it?\n",
