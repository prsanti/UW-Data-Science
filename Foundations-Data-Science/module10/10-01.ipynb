    "\n",
    "1. We will explore the key ideas behind relational databases and how they're used. Then we will review the basics of **Structured Query Language (SQL)** which is used to access and manipulate databases. We will learn SQL commands and how they can be used with Python to query database tables.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will examine tools for moderately sized datasets. Many machine learning and data analysis tools are available that work well when your dataset is small enough to be handled in the memory of a single computer. For truly *big* data, special tools that will be covered in the Big Data course are required. For now we will look at a sample of several such tools for smaller datasets, often collectively referred to as business intelligence tools.<br><br>\n",

    "SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard and was initially designed for relational database management systems. Initially developed at IBM by Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce in the early 1970s, ANSI SQL works with most SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **SQL database** (as opposed to NoSQL) most often refers to a **relational database**. As we discussed above, a relational database is simply a collection of **relations**. Relations are a list of **tuples** or records of equivalent length and types. Tuples contain attributes of primitive data types, such as strings, dates, and numbers. The most common implementation of a relation is a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while relational databases are the most well-formalized type of database, they are not the oldest. The oldest databases are actually **key-value stores**. These are the database analogs of Maps and Dictionaries. This is largely due to the ease of implementing them with normal file systems. An example of such a database in modern times is Amazon's *S3*, which is specifically designed for storing large files (e.g. videos), made accessible by a string identifier."

With `GROUP BY` alone, aggregates can be retrieved via `SELECT`. `HAVING` allows selection of rows with those aggregate properties. For example, `GROUP BY` can be used to obtain the aggregate of column 2 while grouping on column 1. But when invoked with `HAVING`, the actual row/record *having* the aggregate value specified can be returned, not just the aggregate value.\n",
